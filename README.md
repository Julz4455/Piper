## Quick Description

Yeah, so this is just a small template for Discord bot developers. It's base was built using eris-sharder and eris. Enjoy I guess.

## Usage

It is recommended that you use `yarn` instead of `npm` because it provides a better, faster, and far more friendly experience. But, you may use `npm` in place of `yarn` if so desired.

## TODO

* Document all the code
* Expand upon the code
  * Database Integrations (PostgreSQL)
  * Voice functions (ytdl-core)
  * Advanced eval (ava)
* Make it easier to actually ***template***
